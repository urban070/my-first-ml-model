# My First ML Model
My first attempt at machine learning.
I used this repo as a reference: https://github.com/dataprofessor/first-ml

The model recognizes increment patterns and predicts the 5th number, based on user input.

Example queries and responses:

```
: 3,4,5,6
My prediction for the next number in this pattern is:  6.999999999999959

: 100,200,300,400
My prediction for the next number in this pattern is:  499.99999999999994

: 100,211,322,433
My prediction for the next number in this pattern is:  544.0
```
